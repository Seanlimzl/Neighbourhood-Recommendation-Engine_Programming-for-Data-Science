    It can sometimes be hard to make a decision on where to live in Singapore, especially if you are buying a new or resale HDB.
    This tool aims to help you find a URA subzone within your income bracket that still has the amenities and characteristics you desire.
    This may be of help if you are comparing potential properties between neighbourhoods.
